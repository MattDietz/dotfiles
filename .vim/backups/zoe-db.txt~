my test failed during the install
%
ERROR: /bin/sh: 1: xslt-config: not found

%
smurf
%

%
i don't even know what it is

and where can i find it?
%
okay
%

%
i c
%
ohw.. i don't have to test it by build?
%
but I'm not a sudo user at smurf

%
i must install something.. otherwise... my htmldiff won't work
%

brosenberg: the correct sentence is "This incident will be reported."
%

%
home video????
%
i don't wanna watch
%
\o
%
when people say "install hadoop cluster".. what does it really mean?
%
does it mean.. .i create 1 vm.. and install hadoop on that vm?
%
or .. i should create a bunch of vms on each node... and install hadoop 1 by 1?
%
why do i care if they play nice TOGETHER????
%
do they actually talk to each other?
%
thank u guys
%
btw... youtube works
%
irc
%

%
i could be that fast-rabbit if u pay me

tast-rabbit
%
cuz converting python sounds more doable than hadoop
%
brosenberg: i made 5 vms
%
with had oops..
%
but i don't know how to make them TALK to each other
%
yes
%

%
fcarpenter makes me google translate a lot diff animals.. such as iguana...
%
peecock
%
or.. some other weird animal u normally don't think
%
Krsna: i should pull out all my google translator records
%
dlenwell: what? that is what they ask  u during the interview?
%
ohw.. 
%
me.. chinese.. don't get sarcasm
%
http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2418153/Claire-used-1-Nivea-cream-half-face--105-Cr-la-Mer-The-results-VERY-revealing.html
%
A and B test .. just like nick
%
okay...
%
how to control?
%
if it is a A/B test?
%
ohw.. i c i c
%
but then. it is not fun
%
maybe she should divid her face in 3 parts
%
so.. she can compare no cream, cream A and cream B
%
but i also think it is impossible to divid ur face in 3 parts
%
cuz u can only have left and right
%
who is she?
%
she needs hair
%
that is too much
%
just becuz i m chinese.. doesn't mean i eat a whale
%
i won't
%
i assume every animal taste better than human?
%
ohw.. that is right..
%
they do.. 
%
i saw south park ... they show it
%
i hate becon
%
what's the root pwd for cluster 28?
%
mmmm...
%

%
yes
%
thank u ~~~~~~~~~~
%
tnorth: u know everything!
%
okay...
%
i m just curious who else have 5 nodes beside cluster 20
%
sigh.. okay... 
%
i will just use 20 then
%
novas0x2a|laptop: do u think if it makes sense that I add "ignored-data" in whitelist of teacup/common/utils.py    wait_for_node
%
?
%
i m running into a situation that after i remove the node... it actually removes the node.. but put the node in ignore-data.... 
%
so.. i wonder if puts "ignore-data" in whitelist of that wait_for_node()  making sense at all
%
wait..i take my question back
%
damn it
%
i have to re-think about the whole thing
%
sigh.. i know
%
but i donno how . yet... let me think think
%
ha.. 
%
how do u know my problem
%
wait...
%
so..no
%
novas0x2a|laptop: u saying put "want-config" in blacklist?
%
so..
%
i will make it expect "igonore-data" and put "want-config" in the blacklist....
%
so it will stop when it is want-config?
%
but.. does it always put the node into "igonore-data" status after we remove it
%
?
%
ohw.. interesting..
%
u do know everything
%
ciao
%
i wonder why it is called silliamWhakespeare
%
is the popcorn vegetarian?
%
Krsna: only when i eat pizza
%
and i don't consider chicken as meat
%
....
%
chicken tastes like cardbard
%
most of the time
%
interesting... what would u know? u r a veggitarian
%
vegetarian
%
agree
%
agree more
%
kill him?
%
ewww
%
and grill it
%
brosenberg:  so fattarsi agrees?
%
i can only assumw
%
summe
%
assume
%
me no question now
%
hello ericfrank 
%
novas0x2a: 
%
novas0x2a:  do  u know what does this do? release, _created = florin_models.Release.objects.get_or_create(build=build, digest=digest, flags=flags) 
%
this is in update test
%
so.. the flags here.. is  Choices are: available_to, build, created, digest, id, notes, updated
%
so .. if i run into 
%
FieldError: Cannot resolve keyword 'flags' into field. Choices are: available_to, build, created, digest, id, notes, updated
%
why is it something to do with django.db?
%
fattarsi: how would i know if i rebase or not? if i did git log.. and it shows the update
%
fattarsi: it means... i have the latest version, right?
%
git fetch, git rebase, git log
%
mmmm....
%
does following sound reasonable? 
%
"An ancient Egyptian, Chinese and Indian therapy, which focuses on specific reflex points on the bottom of the feet, which corresponds to specific parts of the body. Using acupressure techniques to stimulate these points brings about self-healing and balance to the body. Reflexology can help eliminate toxins, relax the entire body, and stimulate healthy functioning internal organs. "
%
so.. egyptian , chinese and indian do the same study?
%
i m in
%
it is in my hood
%
i thought fcarpenter is married
%
brosenberg: u can
%
brosenberg: there is N line near the resturant
%
why it is mike's turf? there is no lawn around that izakaya place
%
what?????
%
i hv never been that izakaya
%
there is always a line in front of that izakaya... so.. i never waited
%
wait.. i think i misunderstood the location
%
it is mike's turf
%
but it is in mission as well.. based on yelp
%
brosenberg: sorry.. i misunderstood the location... otherwise, i can drive u to the  bart station
%
if u r dared to sit in  my car and not scream when i m driving
%
it is...  
%
brosenberg: my ex has nightmare.. in the middle of night.. cuz he dreamed that he sits in my car while i m driving
%
there is an oh-shit bar in my car

NSA: but i m  american

%
why it shows NSA in ur window
%

%
i did say NSA 
%
i m confused...
%

%
agree
%
klondike oreo is yummy
%
better than that it's it
%
what do you guys do while waiting the build never finishing
%
i hate space
%
i think the bot discriminate me
%
this is ridiculous
%
and it is all the build's fault... 
%
if the build can finish faster... i wouldn't end up chatting with a bot
%
fcarpenter: thank you!!!!
%
fattarsi: it is me.. again
%
fattarsi: there is a  AttributeError: at  test_00_download_fails    
%
fattarsi: how can i fix that?
%
agree
%
why it will be a time out for ssh
%
arr....
%
i think it will be fattarsi 's problem
%
such as?
%
okay... NSA: i will check them.. thank u 
%

%
fattarsi: is that normal that my node goes to error:pause status once i did the update?
%
people: besides of cProfile or Profile... is there any other modules i can use for timing my stuff?
%
maybe  i should just use datetime
%
i wanna calculate how long to ensure_vm till that vm is active
%

%
it is just a small thing i need to put on the pivotal
%

as fast as instant?
%
gee
%
interesting..
%
but what i don't understand is.. why that gril is blowing dry her hair 
%
and hold that instant food?
%
i assume it means.. she can dry her hair while she eats her breakfast
%
does anyone know 
%
 Selenium-RC  .. what does RC stand for?

%
brosenberg: yes
%
brosenberg:  it is 1.9

%
brosenberg:  do u install at wheelbarrow3? why not wheelbarrow1?
%
brosenberg:  do u mind if i see u doing it ?

%
brian starts to write code?
%
it is "become someone else" day
%
is there a command to shutdown all the vas once?
%
is stocks related to my power off?
%
i m confused by what obama says
%
the whole car thing make me headache
%
ohw.. no wonder
%
fattarsi:  how come mine.. doesn't work that way? let me try it again
%
fattarsi:  ha... my bad.. i ssh to the host not that ip
%
people:
%
can i use cluster 20 for testing 2.5.3 for 1 hr?
%
after current fattarsi 's build?
%
since it is the only free cluster with 5 nodes
%
hahahah
%
Mandell: cracks me up
%
we should have a command for IRC
%
like "everybody freeze! i need cluster 20"
%
novas0x2a:  i think u were right of return cluster_version as string...
%
cuz it sounds more sense than a tuple? lol
%
well.. i can change it to tuple... but i just think "2.5.2345" looks more sense than (2, 5, 2345)  ?
%
fattarsi: I like carp. I like carp.
%
omg...
%
fattarsi I like carp. I like carp.
%
fattarsi: I like carp.  perfect
%
fattarsi: I like carp. the answer is ? yes or no?
%
but it isn't merge
%
i didn't know u hate 2.5.3 so much
%
fcarpenter:  u got my mistake! thank you!
%
fcarpenter: i made some var which i forgot to use...
%
wait... i didn't
%
i accidentally press enter... now my cluster is installing the wrong version
%
http://www.tendergreens.com
%
too bad that i can't upload the pic to irc
%
nick: http://www.tendergreens.com
%
fattarsi: it is called Q restaurant
%
.....
%
so cute....
%
there is a reason i always click the links in irc
%
anyone wants frozen yogurt?
%
i hate the music
%
well... maybe it is not the music
%
ha... after talking to my mom... my test passes
%
yay...
%
my breakfast is so yummy...  .a.k.a. skinny cow
%
and it is the last skinny cow
%
fcarpenter:  mmmm... i need to re-think of that...
%
it is not just ice cream...  it is a sandwitch
%
ewwwww.....
%
fcarpenter:  i think u miss brosenberg  too much
%
is novas0x2a  still sick?
%
r u comming?
%
u see... u, brosenberg  and brian  are all sick
%
Mandell:  u r sick , too?
%
clearly...
%
they should have make some sound when that dog pops up
%
or when he waves his hand
%
holly crap! how did u make it?
%
i need to learn this
%
novas0x2a: that sad song at supermarket ? is supper good
%
kind like how i feel when i m at supermarket
%
interesting... that is how my cat reacts when he eats chicken drump 
%
he made that sound only when he sees chicken meat or some real meat
%
or a bug
%
fcarpenter:  i just wanna say "I knew it" when i read ur email this morning
%
novas0x2a: i was thinking that pie earlier, too.... 
%
can i borrow a cluster for 5 secs?
%
i just needs to send the request to dash board
%
novas0x2a:  so.. we can poke ur face/nose.. and say "boop" ?
%
i did http://31.media.tumblr.com/844938edba646e487dbe50a2835b0ed1/tumblr_msml75gFSk1qm62s4o1_400.gif  to my cats all the time
%
novas0x2a:  i have a question... 
%
ha... thank u thank u
%
that is really good answer....
%
cuz now... i don't feel that i have to change it
%
good mornning
%
see you
%
since i don't have a cluster... i decide to bother everyone with questions
%
so... what's the code policy for the old cod
%
if i have a function called "test_me"
%
and i wanna leave it in the file but not gona use it
%
should i do "__test_me" ?
%
old code .. not old cod
%
cod is some sort of japanese fish dinner
%
i think PerryKerry goes crazy
%
WHY ????
%
WHY????
%
this is NOT fair
%
thanks
%
Yes
%
can we have those for friday lunch?!
%
maybe...
%
maybe...
%
one of our awesome co-worker...
%
can .. bring them to us tmr?
%
mmmm.......... i mean.. novas0x2a|laptop 
%
since he lives closed by
%
we can chip in umber's fare
%
pick him up at his place..send him to sandwich place.. and drop him to the office
%
shit
%
thank u 
%
but i can't do it now.. cuz i m at home now
%
...>_<...
%
but i can edit my other branch for update since it is at smurf
%
this commercial is so harlarious
%
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glL0qF2ZI5Y
%
can we still get that gum?
%
i feel so relaxed to hear the background music
%
it works... i already feel sleepy at 20th sec
%
that almost puts me into sleep
%
brosenberg:  can i borrow ur cluter?
%
i guess no...
%
i could tell
%
wajajja
%
thank u !!!!
%
i don't understand sv-grandpa
%
nick:  bow zoo   and bad_support
%
Wat?
%
novas0x2a: is this a real implement?
%
Wait Until Page Contains Element  //table[@class='myTable']  5 seconds
%
novas0x2a: i think i have to install SeleniumLibrary
%
yes
%
i thought u want me to use that http://robotframework-seleniumlibrary.googlecode.com/hg/doc/SeleniumLibrary.html?r=2.8#Wait%20Until%20Page%20Contains%20Element
%
novas0x2a:  http://robotframework-seleniumlibrary.googlecode.com/hg/doc/SeleniumLibrary.html?r=2.8#Wait%20Until%20Page%20Contains%20Element
%
novas0x2a:  okay.. this look better
%
where is it?
%
wat?
%
for some reason...  i think function tests take longer and longer
%
maybe i become less patient
%
what's wrong with github?
%
now it is back
%
i could change WebDriverWait for id
%
but i can't change  self.driver.find_element_by_css_selector('.btn.btn-danger.pull-right').click()
%
let me wait my cluster back to answer the question
%
yap
%
and?
%
no content?
%
but no content?
%
oka
%
okay
%
thank u
%
that is so mean
%
fattarsi:  what's ur new class name?
%
ranger?
%
which doesn't even make sense in funny way
%
....
%
u guys know what is most difficulty working at piston?
%
even understanding jokes is very difficult
%
sigh... requires too much brain cells
%
i didn't know we have a blog
%
http://www.pistoncloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/7648831920_cf283798a2_o.jpg   Am i the most right one?
%
this pic is from http://www.pistoncloud.com/2013/10/recruiting-for-diversity/
%
hahaha
%
it is amazing to me that you people remember the quotes or deialog from the cartoon or movie you see 
%
you.. people
%
that  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Smurfs  is actually a cute story
%
tdelporto:  nick went home for a nap
%
http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/you_people
%
whahaha.. how do u know I am googling this?
%
whahah
%
yes
%
when can we attend krsna 's wedding?
%
actually.., if he marries with a bunch of wires... does it mean we have to give him more money for wedding gift?
%
yeah.. we, chinese, give red envelop with money as wedding gift
%
yeah....
%
but the guests come to your wedding and eat the food.. of course, they have to pay
%
there shouldn't be any guilt
%
fattarsi:  was ur build 2.6.6179 ?
%
fattarsi: http://smurf/builds/fattarsi/ids/release/
%
la la la la 
%
so quiet
%
la la la
%
can i complain?
%
what's the reason.. i click the update button it download the update but not really update?
%
ha.. maybe becuz license
%
make sure u can record the latest update and put it on youtube
%
mmm.. i figure...
%
does it sound normal IF  test_01_same_version                                         OK    985.88
%
i mean the timewise...
%
it is much shorter than before
%
ha.. i c...
%
i cheated the test.. i made the update test as basic test instead of extended
%
The moral of story is... if we run 3 extend fund tests in the row.. the scale inout won't work...
%
does anyone know how to check the history of your order on Uber?
%
there must be a way, right?
%
does out salad bar come with chicken or not?
%
but... does that grilled chicken show up ?
%
but there is no chicken
%
chicken on the phone
%
where does eiffel towered from?
%
is any one using any 5 nodes cluster?
%
mmmmm.... okay
%
salad is not food
%
not my food
%
: ლʕಠᴥಠʔლ
%
don't shoot me
%
how come u can have that 凸 pic?
%
i c
%
besides of shooting... the bears or human
%
does 29 have more than 4 nodes?
%
sigh...
%
ciao
%
what does no-quorum really mean?
%
novas0x2a:  so.... "no-quorum" is normal at beginning of installing?
%
at very beginning...
%
yes i do
%
dev -b install
%
how can i check if grandpa is dead?
%
beside of checking cluster-info?
%
so.. in this case... grandpa is not dead
%
r u sure? cuz no-quorum has been there for last 5 mins
%
and the nodes status were booting.. but now it moves to provisioning-full
%
i c
%
so.. while buttercup installing.. can get get cluster-info?
%
so.. it should be optimal... even it is not true
%
let me observe
%
i need to read read first
%
give me 5 mins
%
question.....
%
will this get merge eventually? if it does.....  2.5 won't have it, right?
%
mmmmmmm.....
%
1800-contactlense
%
i got you
%
fcarpenter: THANK YOU!!!!!!
%
checking those sites... almost crash my computer
%
i m gona buy 1 of those camara
%
no...
%

%

%

%
Noway cats are better?
%
http://ffffound.com/image/ed544d414abad9ddeb8670702b401c8865c09c60
%
i think the pic i got is cutter
%
clearly
%
so.... sad...  once my code get merged.. it failed
%
i m gona put an orange on marble then
%
cluster 19 is dead
%
i love you... brosenberg 
%
okay... i just install 19
%
3 secs ago
%
sigh... I think ... i ruined cluster 19 again
%
yes .. please...
%
but i wonder why it is ruined
%
all i did is to install it over and over again
%
thank u....
%
19 is the slowest one,right?
%
sigh
%
is there a reason that what i did really hurt it?
%
all i did is some sort of dev install
%
ha... that might be the reason
%
is it possible that zeroCater will block me to write review?
%
i just did... 
%
i mean.. stating the fact
%
yap
%
but why does he pee there?
%
another lesson learned is.. never borrow the books from library
%
u don't know where those books have been
%
or... what kind of nutrition that book gets 
%
or what kind of shower those book get
%
ewww
%
yeah... that is my specialty 
%
talk about cat vedio... 
%
i saw some youtube that novas0x2a sent... about putting stuff on  the head of cat's head....
%
i start to put stuff on my cat's head
%
video....
%
and i will upload pics...
%
i only put orange on my cat
%
when i put 3 oranges on her head... i feel so guilty and apology to her
%
then... as a chinese... i collect that.. and cook it
%
gee....
%
krsna:  no wonder.. u don't eat my orange
%
poor cow
%

%

%
WAIT
%

%
[root@arista-172-17-0-1 ~]# dev -b install -s piston/2.5/master -v 2.5.6238
%
i will.... 
%
it is in the server room?
%
sigh... i will
%
i donna why .. .nowadays... i either put the cluster server-require or not able to ssh in
%
WHAT?!?!!?!?
%
i love vivien
%
she has the best taste
%
fcarpenter:  did u fix 17?
%

%
lmao
%
i thought there is a song for that
%
i hv  a ringtone
%
for that song
%
what eta?
%
Mandell.. u can use cluster 19 ... as long as u don't install it
%
coffeeee????
%
i need ice  mocha
%
that is unfair
%
perfectly
%
heheh.. since cluster 19 becomes 1 node...
%
everything becomes quicker 
%
and.. cluster-17 is dead
%
again
%
i ask myself same question for the past few days
%
but this time... hehehe... i document it
%
anyway, it is back ... maybe i was panic
%
since u r awake.... hehehe... could u tell me where i should hit for check_update ?
%
https://smurf.i.pistoncloud.com:11111
%
is this correct place i should make self.grandpa('private/oooxxx', '')
%
yes
%
so.... i made  update_server to hit smurf.i.pistoncloud.com
%
so.. in check_update.... it should hit the same url
%
yes
%
and the url = https://smurf.i.pistoncloud.com
%
u mean.. the json response i m waiting for? should be 443?
%
okay.. the actual url = https://smurf.i.pistoncloud.com:11111
%
so... my port is 1111
%
my question is how come i got 503 
%
teacup.common.utils: INFO: connecting to http://172.17.0.1:10010/private/check-update

what exactly is  update/since/2.5.5923?
%
can i ask what do u mean "update server logs"?
%
u mean.. smurf.i.pistoncloud.com?
%
let me read more of var/log 
%

that is what we send to update server?
%
what did i do again?
%
i didn't touch any cluster
%
sigh..........

%

%

%

%

%
i don't like hairless cat
%

%
My cat actually eat pseudo
%
i just realized....  u can hit that vote link for a lot of times... and it counts as N votes.. intend of 1
%
....
%
i have 2
%
novas0x2a|laptop: cluster 19 is installing 2.5.5596  or 2.5.5923
%
novas0x2a:  u can take it AFTER it is finish... since i m sure it is not the version i want
%
fattarsi:  so.. far... i don't think so
%
fattarsi: but i can try again
%
brosenberg:  WHY?
%
WHY?WHY?WHY???
%
sorry ... novas0x2a  : my cluster is 17
%
i m not mad....
%
i think i have been cluster-hopping
%
like bar hopping
%
novas0x2a:  cluster-17 is about to be 2.5.xxxx
%
u r wellcome
%
no internet
%
i have mice
%
murder
%
hehehe
%
we have a dir, called "pill" ?
%
mmmm... 
%
so... 
%
i think i have to understand /build-world.sh in Mircale...funtional.sh in git-tool 
%
that is a cool idea
%
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vx1OVLX5Rc
%
i wish we could gps the lunch
%
like where is our lunch is .. right now
%
how far is it?
%
ect
%
thx brosenberg 
%
is it a bar on 240 font st?
%
\o/ mg
%
really?
%
but u guys are closer...
%
it is like hovering my cluster
%
when i check my cluster info over and over again.. and wish it is up faster
%
yeah... can we have that method?
%
but i guess the method is not to put it in servce-require at first place
%
fattarsi: + 1
%
is it from old movie?
%
why do i have to see this during lunch time?
%
there is a relationship status on git?
%
or.. wait.. that is ur branch name?
%
mmm... why do i need to hear that?
%
if i already know
%
unless ur partner uses git..... and he can use command like git checkout xxx
%
then u know
%
open another window then
%
use other machine
%
u guys are so wrong
%
will it be a good idea that... when cluster is up, there is music file playing
%
u hear the music, u know the cluster is up
%
maybe i should start to watch sesame street to improve my english
%
sigh x 1000
%
even with 1 node cluster.... i m still in the service-require status
%
all the time
%
so.. my dear peeps
%
does anyone know if we can update 1 node cluster in theory?
%
from 2.6.1111 to 2.6.1111
%
sigh...
%
the thing is...
%
i have been cluster hopping..... sometimes.. it works.. sometimes.. it doesn't 
%
u know.. after ruin one... i jump to other cluster
%
i know....
%
yap yap yap
%
but now.... people toss a cluster like a trash
%
that person looks like pycho
%
kind of like how i talk to cluster-19
%
i m glad that the problem is not me... it is the cluster
%
anyway.. i will try one more time....
%
to see if it is really me or the cluster
%
i think  I m used to see "service-required"  s.. I'm at 1 point that i don't care anymore.. .just re install it
%
and i never realize which cluster it is
%
i should play my rington
%
ringtone
%
we should have a command called "!rob 17"
%
no.. i mean... rob a bank;s rob
%
mmm... clearly krsna  never robbed a bank
%
i never rob the bank either
%
btw.. i think my cat was either scared by mice or had a nightmare last night
%
besides of Casl
%
why space is so important to sh?
%
mmmm.... 
%
i can't deal with it...
%
but all i know is
%
once i add 1 space.. it works
%
and i don't even know why
%
wahahah
%
If
%
for pp in  "1,2,3"; echo pp
%
does this even make sense?
%
so it has to be a space to separate things not ","
%
then i m screwed
%
so... my data type should be "mmm sass qqq" instead of "mmm, sass,qqq"
%
not even quote it?
%
shell doesn't make sense
%
so.. if i have a string = 'aaa,bbb,ccc'
%
'aaa bbb ccc'
%
how to make it?
%
ha
%
i know
%
i got it
%
HA!!! it really works!!!!
%
so.. how to assign 'aaa,bbb,ccc' | $p =sed 's/,/ /g'  to a variable $zzz   ?
%
this is amazing
%
okay... it is all me
%
+1
%
means... no one ?
%
fcarpenter:  i will ask shadow
%
that dog is funny.... i m surprised he doesn't bark
%
fattarsi:   how to set up the name of REPO ?
%
did u set my REPO as Upgrade?
%
where did u do that?
%
fattarsi:  kind of both
%
how does jerkin knows which repo?
%
jerk jenkin
%
but where?
%
GITHUB_OWNER/GITHUB_BRANCH doesn't tell u REPO
%
maybe get both will be cheaper
%
hopefully, there is a buy 1 get 1 free
%
here
%
PWD=/root/jenkins/workspace/Upgrade Tests
%
yap....
%
but i don't wanna go to space
%
his name is jerk..kins
%

%
ha.. no worry
%
i am using cluster-20
%
i know... i might be able to use 14,19, 15....
%
so far.. my only option is 20... cuz 14,19,15... are single or not healthy nodes
%
yeah... thank u !!!!
%
i can't use 29 or 29.. cuz DNS.. problem...well/.... i forgot what actually reason
%
something to do with DNS
%
so.. 28 and 29 can't talk to update servers
%
i c i c......
%
so... can u help me modify the appropriate bootstrap config?
%
ha... thank you thank u
%

%
okay....
%

%
since i m gona run a  long test...
%

%

%
that cat seems cute
%
_0x44:  r u gona be online for another 1 hr?
%
cuz i wonder if u can enable the functional test on jenkins.. in 1 hr
%
i disable it.... since i m running update tests
%
can nick enable it?
%
really? even i am the one who disable it?
%
i just wanna make sure  i don't block anyone from running functional tests
%
tomorrow morning
%
okay... thank you....
%
what?
%
mmm.. that is what i typed
%
what is ellipses?
%
.. ... ...
%
those are just normal ...
%
anyway... i think my update auto tool is coming alone... but i skip the scale/in/out
%
and i think i need to modify full shutdown update test ... something fishy happen
%
anyway.. going to bed now... ciao ... 
%
can i mention the pwd for cluster28 here?
%
can i ?
%
since i wanna complain the pwd
%
yes....
%
i know.. i m gona change it to my cat name
%
i wanna take fluffy home
%
so.. my cat Marble can school him
%
and this is a good pwd?  http://imgur.com/EWpphBt
%
do not even think of my cluster 28
%
NO!!!!
%
i m having food coma
%
doth cluster could be "thaw-wait" ????
%
can i re-install cluster 28?
%
so....
%
if    " ping 172.28.3.11 -W 3 -c 1 " doesn't work
%
which means.. test_security_groups  test fails
%
can i just skip that test? wahahah
%
http://imgur.com/KEKtFV9
%
yap....
%
i m having them
%
how come it becomes 6237?
%
anyway... 
%
don't are
%
thank u very much
%
novas0x2a: r u there?
%
i hope so... since i don't wanna put myself in all the sic-fi movie situation
%
i have a question... u know for that piston dashboard driver... does it really make sense to pass version value to it?
%
so far,,,, it has all the login, pwd... ect....
%
for example... we change front-end and there might be different version
%
the best example might be that class fattarsi  changed "update-installable"
%
okay....
%
so... in this case,.. since it is pretty rare but i see it will happen more in the future
%
updates = find_xpath(ooxxx)
%
if not updates:   find_xpath( another pattern )
%
will that be okay?
%
okay...
%
thank you
%
what time does nightly build start?
%
nope...
%
but i m using cluster 28
%
what?
%
what do u mean?
%
yes...
%
but it is running cluster 28?
%
so... 
%
u r saying ... i m using same func env for my update test....
%
which is true
%
let me read read
%
so.. if ... i make my update test in diff env... this will solve?
%
let me pause my test first...
%
cuz.. i happen to schedule 3 of them in th que.. already
%
sorry about that... 
%
so... where is this env....? i mean... physically
%
what are "two things" you refer to ?
%
which makes sense but not really make sense
%
for example... 
%
that teacup -venv is set by run-functional-test
%
so.. in my jerkin, if i set env = "ppp" in my update_test
%
and pass it to that run-fundtional-test....  
%
p?
%
why?
%
pop is just an example
%
but u got me curious
%
ha... i saw it
%
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerkin_%28garment%29
%
this is funny....
%
i think i m going to sleep now
%
99
%
why?
%
omg....
%
fcarpenter:  u might die to eat 12 eggs once
%
there are other ways to die happy ... i think
%
fattarsi: 
%
anyway... jerkin doesn't pick the right wheelbarrle
%
gosh... i can't type
%
i!food
%
i can't type today
%
mt head spin
%
no no
%
me no
%
damn it
%
i was eyed on 17
%
fcarpenter:  and Mandell  are doing cluster swaping
%
thank you! fcarpenter 
%
krsna: DID YOU ROB MY/ CLUSTER???
%
really???
%
okay...
%
okay.. take 28 then
%
i m using 17
%
the bot is not accurate
%
can i make a pull - request... but NOT aquash?
%
squash
%
http://news-hound.net/samsung-pays-apple-1-billion-sending-30-trucks-full-of-5-cent-coins/
%
30 trucks for real?
%
novas0x2a:   can i make my env as 
%
things like 
%
New python executable in /var/tmp/update-venv-bowzoo-update_44ever/bin/python
%
so it has my test owner and test branch
%
this is so piston style cat
%
with the bow
%
http://sfist.com/2013/11/06/best_breakfast_pastries_in_san_fran.php
%
is there a reason that my dear cluster 17 doesn't look like it used to be?
%
i release all the clusters i have
%
http://www.buzzfeed.com/mattbellassai/things-that-are-way-more-important-than-work-right-now
%
+1
%
i think fattarsi  can do that job  better
%
that cat is dumb
%
fcarpenter:  i can't give u cluster 17
%
and u should take rest
%
ohw...
%
she should hit her head
%
\o
%
sorry... i forgot to release them
%
i didn't touch cluster 14.... 
%
good good good.....
%
back to my cluster-hopping days.... I only ruin 17, 19, 20, 28
%
lalalalal
%
yes... i think so... i didn't crash any...
%
now.. i m waiting u finish ur functional test on 20
%
i hope not.... but i don't know
%
cluster 28 is urs.. i won't use it
%
that kid deserves it
%
or wear Bacteria clothing
%
i have that mucinex with me
%
in the office
%
i m the walgreen!
%
http://cheezburger.com/3763150592
%
i m back to my tempest profemace testing...
%
fcarpenter:  is it possible that i can switch 19 with u for 17?
%
really?!  thank you thank oyu
%
eric: i create one of ur build
%
novas0x2a:  we can only create 10 vm 
%
for at most, right?
%
?where can i reset the quotas
%
i wanna make 50
%
well.. if it is possible
%
i think http://dashboard-17/project/
%
why delete tiny vm takes forever?
%
for....ever
%
derek:  can i use cluster-28?
%
novas0x2a:  did you mention logging or locking in the scrum today?
%
and u were saying locking?
%
got it... thank you
%
if i need to work on logging problem?
%
what?
%
ari:  i don't think cluster-28 is free... derek  is using it.... and i m in the que... to wait that cluster
%
^__^
%
nick:  in ur jenkins, do u see "Manage Jenkins"  link?
%
Locks 
%
me too
%
then... i just comment that thing out
%
i comment that 'python-libarchive>=3.1.2', out
%
yes
%
at least to me...   maybe becuz i only use it for teacup?
%
mmmm... true
%
is that what nick fix before?
%
let see see see
%
oops....
%
and it works for smurf now
%
hungry
%
btw... why can't i change my name to chinese
%
c..u...t...e
%
hahah.. u notice...
%
there is no log
%
i mean... there is no log  yet
%
that is why i ask u if i can change capature-log.py
%
and i will set it as update-test-2.6.xxxx.-29?
%
for example
%
okay.. 
%
i c... i c...
%
?
%
u mean.. even i ask jerkin NOT run that capture-log.py
%
it will still call it?
%
i c...
%
i m gona change capture-log now
%
btw.. when u say build server, u mean ... something like smurf:/home/shared/builds/piston/2.5/master/debug/functional-test-2.6.6398-59.log.gz  ?
%
i just wanna make sure i understand what u said
%
and when u said "test it by hand extensively" ... can i modify my capature-log.py and run it on cluster 28... 
%
and write the log to smurf:/home/shared/builds/piston/2.5/master/debug/update-test-2.5.xxxx-59.log.gz  
%
but which directory?
%
should it still be shared/builds/piston/2.5/master/debug?
%
got it
%
i know i know...
%
ahhh... this is not worthy.. after so much work, they only got 1 bowl of dog food
%
from dog point of view.... not worth it
%
but u can't eat those tennis balls
%
u see? my cat complains when we do the daily laps now
%
i don't understand dogs... 
%
yay... we have  Mushroom Quiche today
%
cuz it is in ur hood
%
i always wanna try the steer hot dogs in mission
%
true...
%
one question... why do we have to pay someone to ear all the food? Can't we just pay to the restaurant?
%
Shawn:  i just release 28
%
please take it
%
Shawn:  i was installing 2.5.6377
%
thank you derek 
%
i will take the same note with fcarpenter 
%
i thought we are only supposed to share funny easy understand url
%
this cassandra is too complicated to even read
%
IF i m deleting a vm... or a bunch of vms
%
how would i know they are not going any where?
%
like.. how m i know they are doing what they claim they are doing?
%
they said they are deleting.... but ... it has been so long...
%
mmmmmm.... okay... i will try
%
yes...
%
i run some script...
%
and the dashboard doesn't seem acurate
%
or .. i m just dreaming
%
sigh
%
http://172.17.2.2/admin/instances/
%
i saw this cat last night!
%
how so?
%
krsna: i didn't see ur build at all
%
it is funny!
%
i don't think so
%
all the VMs should leave my cluster-17
%
but they just stay there forever
%
almost my life
%
btw... that LL Cool J - Going Back To Cali is not music
%
it is just a bunch of noise
%
i donno
%
i donna WTH r u talking about
%
what't the relationship bw teen floating_ips and vms ?
%
if i have 1 vm, how many floating ups does have vm own?
%
okay... that is the answer i m looking for
%
it is nikc
%
i thought that polar bear will eat those dogs
%
my day is so good.. with  that Pollo Alla Gabriele makes my day
%
so sorry to hear it
%
honestly...  i can't count how many muffin we are talking about
%
 two-thirds of one-half of an english muffin.
%
what is one-half? 0.5 or 1.5?
%
ohw.. i c
%
i think this is more difficult than 4 grade math
%
for sure
%
yap....
%
but please not bring back the virus to office
%
i m not sure if there is something wrong with IRC.. or  my monitor is dirty
%
true
%
task rabbit front-end is too confusing
%
should we invite Beth F from ZeroCater to our company party?
%
why? do u know her?
%
is she italian?
%
she seems very nice
%
krsna:  can u see her pic?
%
damn.. i was not joking... 
%
i think like 25 
%
she looks like 25
%
i saw her pic
%
but again.. i m not good to tell white people's age...
%
one time.. i meet this white lady.. i thought she is like 40... but then.. i realize she is 70
%
me no understand
%
i m not!
%
that is how my mom looks
%
+1
%
air tix is so expensive
%
maybe i should take a boat back to taiwan
%
but it might be much cheaper
%
or cargo
%
like the movie bad grandpa?
%
no... i meet one person.. he told me that he takes cargo for traveling
%
yeah...
%
good to known
%
thank you!
%
i think we should add another keyword
%
like "rob"
%
"!rob 28"
%
fattarsi:  was that a before and after pic?
%
totally...
%
it is strange to me that his paw is black
%
i thought it should be pink
%
novas0x2a:  r u talking to me?
%
i knew.... i thought i fixed that... and clearly, not
%
sigh
%
but i thought it fails before it even writes
%
which part says it runs the test?
%
i f....
%
i c
%
if i comment that out... can i run it again?
%
i remove the whole post-build task
%
i m running it again
%
it shouldn't effect anyone now
%
i mean.. not writing to the log
%
only 99 cents
%
a toliet paper is more expensive than that
%
so sad
%
.....

if i m writing dashboard test for eric and his code hasn't been merged

no nono

let me explain

btw.. why everyone is online?
%
are u guys still playing the boardgame in the office?
%
perfect
%
i mean.. in the update_same_version test, it copys the build from piston/master
%
since it is not in piston/master... it can't be copied
%
so the update same version test failed.. of course
%
can i modify this part AFTER his code got merged?
%
mmmmmm.... or .. i can skip update_same_version
%
wahahha
%
ciao
%
it failed... since there is no available update

instead of piston/maste
